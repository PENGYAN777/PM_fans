Except fluid MM which has been investigated:
1. dp is not plotted for fluids with zt<0.6, because zt<0.6 is not a good similarity parameter for all fluids.
2. Results of similarity Gamma_1 is not perform since Gamma_1 is not a good similarity parameter for all fluids. 
3. /Delat M2 and P2 is not plotted for simple fluids since they do not exhibit a similarity pattern.
